Hello daniel.

Once I have added you as a collaborator you can then clone our git repository 
onto your computer. We have started work on the challenge.

First follow all the 'git config' instructions on this tutorial http://chryswoods.com/beginning_git/basics.html

Then in a suitable working directory type:
git clone https://github.com/js1435/iwbda

Then when working together if you would follow the rough protovol outlined 
in workflow.txt that would be great!
