An example of good workflow for multi-user git repositories:

git status: if working directory isn't clean then git commit -a
git pull: get changes from others, if there are conflicts then merge then git commit -a then git push to merge
git commit -a: commit your changes that you have now made then git status to ensure your working directory is clean
git pull: pull any changes that anyone might habe made whilst you were working, if there are conflicts then act as above until working directory is clean
when git pull causes no changes and git status shows that yor working directory is clean then git push to push your work to the cloud
